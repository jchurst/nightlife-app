# FreeCodeCamp API - Nightlife Coordinator App.

## User stories:

1- As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

2- As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

3- As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

4- As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

##Hint: 

Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
